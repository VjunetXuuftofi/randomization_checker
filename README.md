# Check your randomness

How random are you? This app aims to find out. Pretend to flip a coin 100 times, and it will perform two tests on how random your flips were. First, do you switch between heads and tails more or less than randomly? Second, are your "streaks" distributed differently from how they would be randomly?

This was created to replace a similar website that used to exist but is now offline.
